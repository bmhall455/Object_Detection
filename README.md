# Autonomous Obstacle Detection Simulator

This project is a simple C++ simulation of an autonomous vehicle's obstacle detection system. It reads sensor data from a text file and evaluates whether the distance reading is safe. Based on a preset threshold, it either maintains the speed or reduces it, then logs the decision to another file.

## Features

- **Sensor Data Input:**  
  Reads sensor readings (distances in meters) from `sensor_data.txt`.

- **Decision Logic:**  
  - If the sensor reading is below a safe threshold (20 meters), the system maintains a constant speed (55 mph).
  - If the sensor reading exceeds the threshold, the system reduces the speed by 3 mph.
  
- **Output Logging:**  
  Decisions are recorded in `vehicle_log.txt`, indicating whether the vehicle should brake or continue at the current speed.

## File Structure

- **day3_testp2.cpp**: The main C++ source file containing the project code.
- **sensor_data.txt**: A sample text file that contains the simulated sensor data.
- **vehicle_log.txt**:  The output log file generated by the program.
- **input_data.cpp**: C++ source file to develop sample sensor txt files.
- **README.md**: This file.

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++ or Visual Studio)
- Basic command-line knowledge for building and running the program
